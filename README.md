### :woman_technologist: Objective

The scope of this project is limitless with world rushing towards hectic schedules and
monotonous lifestyle. A more personalized solution to detect happiness quo- tient by tracking
user’s social media interaction, profession, age, and numerous other factors. While
psychologists are accessible to people in urban areas, there are not many in rural and remote
areas. Through ’HAPPINESS CHECK’ we can connect psychologists from around the
world directly to people. Also mental health is still considered a stigma in society, spreading
awareness is another aspect of the project. Machine learning and data analysis can help us
spot such people who need help, we can then concentrate our solution on them so that
depression just can’t be cured but also prevented.
